# Use Unofficial dependencies react-apollo-hooks

---

# The Good ✅

- Fetching is encapsulated and declarative
- Data dependencies and expressed alogside where they're used
- All operations are in a single scope
- Loading and error states can be handled in a generalized manner

---

# The Bad 🔴

- ~~SelectionSets are error-prone~~
- ~~Multiple HOCs can produce bugs~~

---

# The Meh 🤷‍♀️

- ~~HOCs are difficult to understand~~
- ~~Options need to be computed far from the component~~
- ~~Welcome back to callback hell~~
- ~~The component hierarchy is extra deep~~
- ~~Loading and error state require boilerplate~~
